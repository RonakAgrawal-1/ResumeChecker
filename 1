Hey Team,

After two incredible years of growing, learning, and making memories from my very first day as a college grad to now, it’s time for me to say goodbye. Working with all of you has been an amazing experience, and I genuinely appreciate the support, fun, and everything we’ve achieved together.

Thank you for all the laughs, teamwork, and encouragement along the way. I’ve learned so much from each of you, and I’ll always cherish the friendships and moments we’ve shared.

Although I’m moving on to new adventures, I hope we stay in touch—feel free to reach out to me at [your email or LinkedIn]. Let’s not be strangers!

Wishing you all continued success, and who knows—maybe our paths will cross again!

Cheers,
Ned
